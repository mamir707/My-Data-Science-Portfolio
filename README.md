# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains code and projects that showcase my skills and experience in the field of data science. Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## Projects

### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

Description: In this project, I use Python to solve a real-world data science problem. The goal is to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

### 2. The GitHub History of the Scala Language

Description: Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, I read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

### 3. Predictive modelling for Agriculture

Description: A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures:

<b> Nitrogen </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> Phosphorous </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> Potassium </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> pH </b> value of the soil
The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?

### 4. Hypothesis testing at health care
Description: Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects.

You work with a non-profit that advocates for pharmaceutical drug safety. One of Its tasks is to create reports on drugs independent of the drug manufacturer. You'll conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. You'll also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

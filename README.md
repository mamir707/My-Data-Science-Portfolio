# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains code and projects that showcase my skills and experience in the field of data science. Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## Projects

### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

Description: In this project, I use Python to solve a real-world data science problem. The goal is to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

### 2. The GitHub History of the Scala Language

Description: Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, I read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

### 3. Predictive modelling for Agriculture

Description: A farmer reached out to you as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures:

<b> Nitrogen </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> Phosphorous </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> Potassium </b> content ratio in the soil
<b> pH </b> value of the soil
The expert realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately. Can you help him?

### 4. Hypothesis testing at health care
Description: Pharmaceutical drugs have become an essential part of our health. Therefore, they need to be safe with little or no adverse effects.

You work with a non-profit that advocates for pharmaceutical drug safety. One of Its tasks is to create reports on drugs independent of the drug manufacturer. You'll conduct several hypothesis tests using Python to determine if the adverse reactions of a hypothetical drug are significant. You'll also check if factors such as age significantly influence the adverse reactions.

### 5. Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing
Description: In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Dr. Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.

### 6. A visual history of noble prize winners
Description: The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?

Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.

### 8. Predicting credit card approvals
Description: Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
We'll use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.

### 9. Google Play store Apps data
Description: This dataset consists of web scraped data of more than 10,000 Google Play Store apps and 60,000 app reviews. apps_data.csv consists of data about the apps such as category, number of installs, and price. review_data.csv holds reviews of the apps, including the text of the review and sentiment scores.

### 10. Analyzing Students' Mental Health in SQL 
Description: Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health? A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.

We explore the students data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.
